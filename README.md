# Unhandled Promise Rejection in Express.js Async Route

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: neglecting proper error handling within asynchronous route handlers.  The `bug.js` file showcases a route that performs an asynchronous operation without comprehensive error management. This can lead to silent failures or unhandled promise rejections, making debugging difficult.

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with robust error handling, showcasing best practices for handling potential issues in asynchronous Express.js routes.

## How to reproduce the bug:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the directory.
3. Run `node bug.js`.
4. Refresh the page multiple times; you will see the server sometimes fails silently.

## Solution:

The solution involves using a `try...catch` block or `.catch()` method for promise rejection to properly handle errors and provide informative responses to the client or log the errors for debugging purposes. Refer to `bugSolution.js` for a detailed implementation.
